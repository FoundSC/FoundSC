🎒 Campus Lost & Found App 🔹 The Problem

Students lose things all the time (water bottles, laptops, IDs, bikes, calculators).

Current systems are clunky → either you email campus police or check a random office.

People who find things don’t have an easy way to post them.

🔹 The Solution

A campus-wide lost & found app where students can:

Report Lost Items → post what you lost, with pics & last seen location.

Report Found Items → upload item pics, drop-off info, or keep until claimed.

Smart Matching → app suggests matches between lost + found reports.

Location Map → pin where items were last seen or turned in.

🔹 Core Features (MVP)

Lost/Found Feed: Scrollable feed of reported items (like a marketplace).

Filters & Search: Search by category (electronics, clothing, IDs, bikes).

Anonymous Option: Post found items without revealing identity.

Notification System: “Someone just reported a found laptop near SNE Library.”

🔹 Possible Tech Stack

Frontend: React Native (iOS + Android).

Backend: Firebase (fast MVP) or Node.js + PostgreSQL.

Image Search AI (Optional): Use something like CLIP/OpenCV to match lost/found pics.

Auth: University SSO (Google OAuth w/ .edu restriction).
